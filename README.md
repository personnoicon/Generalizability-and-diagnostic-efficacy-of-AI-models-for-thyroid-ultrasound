# Generalizability-and-diagnostic-efficacy-of-AI-models-for-thyroid-ultrasound

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for our work “Generalizability and diagnostic efficacy of AI models for thyroid ultrasound”. 

In this study, we utilized a real-world nationwide dataset to construct computer-aided algorithms covering the whole diagnostic process on thyroid ultrasound, including nodule detection, segmentation, and malignant/benign classification. Besides, we evaluated the generalization ability of the segmentation and classification models based on various hospitals, vendors, and regions for the management of thyroid nodule.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of generalizability on model performance in real-world clinical settings and practices, and to find an effective way to integrate the thyroid CAD algorithm in clinical practice.
